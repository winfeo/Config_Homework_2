# NAME

apk upgrade - upgrade installed packages

# SYNOPSIS

*apk upgrade* [<_options_>...] [<_packages_>...]

# DESCRIPTION

*apk upgrade* upgrades installed packages to the latest version available from
configured package repositories (see *apk-repositories*(5)). When no packages
are specified, all packages are upgraded if possible. If list of packages is
provided, only those packages are upgraded along with needed dependencies.

# OPTIONS

*apk upgrade* supports the commit options described in *apk*(8), as well as the
following options:

*-a, --available*
	Reset all packages to versions available from current repositories.
	This resets all versioned dependencies in _world_ (see *apk-world*(5)).
	Additionally, packages are selected from active repositories if possible
	even if it means replacing or downgrading the package.

	This is useful to reset system against new set of packages after updating
	repositories.

*--ignore*
	Upgrade all other packages than the ones listed. This inverts the given
	package name list to mean packages that should not be upgraded.

*-l, --latest*
	Always choose the latest package by version. However, the versions
	considered are based on the package pinning. Primarily this overrides
	the default heuristic and will cause an error to displayed if all
	dependencies cannot be satisfied.

*--no-self-upgrade*
	Do not do an early upgrade of the 'apk-tools' package.

*--prune*
	Prune the _world_ by removing packages which are no longer available
	from any configured repository.

*--self-upgrade-only*
	Only perform a self-upgrade of the 'apk-tools' package.
